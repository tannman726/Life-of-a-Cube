One day Cuboid came across a gang known as the “Quadrangles” a well known street gang of Quadrilaterals known for their mischiefs and scammers. Cuboid went up to the leader of the Quadrangles and wanted to become a normal being. The Quadrangles agreed, but being the scam artist they were. They changed Cuboids life forever 

They made him normal BUT! 
He could not

Cuboid now faces many dangers, including death. 

Will you help our friend Cuboid resecure his life, or will he crumble under the control of the Quadrangles? That’s for you to decide! 
Now..help Cuboid and find his destiny! </p>
