# Life-of-a-Cube
This HTML/CSS/JS project takes real life numbers of natural death by age and disease (heart disease, cancer, lower chronic respiratory disease) and uses them against a life form you would never expect. A simple cube. Your cube is specialized with a face, personality, and life that is truly random every time. Your goal is to get to 122 years old and prove how really lucky old age can be.
